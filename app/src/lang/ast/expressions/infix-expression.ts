/**
 * âš¡ InfixExpression - Binary Operation AST Node
 *
 * Represents binary operations that combine two operands with an operator.
 * Handles arithmetic calculations, logical comparisons, string operations,
 * and boolean logic with proper operator precedence and type handling.
 *
 * @example
 * - Arithmetic: 5 + 3, total * tax, balance - withdrawal
 * - Comparisons: age >= 18, score == 100, name != "admin"
 * - Logical: isActive && hasPermission, isGuest || isAdmin
 * - String operations: firstName + " " + lastName, "Hello" == greeting
