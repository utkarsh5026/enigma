 * üéØ NodeEvaluator - The Universal Evaluation Contract üéØ
 *
 * This interface defines the fundamental contract that all evaluators must
 * follow.
 * Think of it as the universal language that all evaluation modules speak!
 *
 * From first principles:
 * - Every piece of code (AST node) needs to be turned into a runtime value
 * (object)
 * - This transformation happens in a specific context (environment with
 * variables)
 * - The result is always a BaseObject (our universal value container)

 * This interface provides a way for specialized evaluators to delegate back to
 * the main evaluation system. It's like having a phone line to mission control!
 *
 * Why we need this:
 * - Expression evaluators need to evaluate sub-expressions
 * - Statement evaluators need to evaluate nested statements
 * - Function calls need to evaluate arguments
 * - We avoid circular dependencies by using this interface
